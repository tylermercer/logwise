# Logwise

Keep a log of anything

## Brand Reflection Questions

### Goals

* Individuals expressing that Logwise significantly empowers their ability to
grow and reflect
* Paid tier subscriptions
* High SEO placement for keywords related to logging and tracking

### Values

What do you want people to think / feel when they see your brand? What adjectives
or adjective phrases do you want people to associate with your brand?

* Ruthlessly committed to their values (see below).
  * I'm thinking of calling my values "Values with Teeth" or something and listing
  them prominently on Logwise's website
* Having a well-reasoned, defensible stance amid poorly-reasoned AI
  data grifters and self-help apps
* "Wow, these people respect their users"
* "I feel respected, protected, and supported in my self-knowledge goals."

### Questions

1. **Who are you?**
    * Logwise, a bootstrapped company building an offline-first,
    privacy-focused app for logging the things that are important to you
2. **What do you have to say?**
    * Logging the things that are important to you empowers reflection
    and enhances growth and agency
3. **What aren't you?**
    * A helplessness peddler---I don't tell people they _need_ my app to
    succeed in life, nor do I specifically target those who do push this
    dependent mentality (e.g. some life coaches).
    * An AI data grifter---I believe the user's private data in such an app
    should essentially be treated as sacred.
    * A self-help app---Logwise is just a tool to empower you to reflect more
    rigorously and monitor and improve things that matter to you. It's more of a
    productivity app, next to todo-lists and notes, than a self-help app like
    Headspace or Sanvello.
4. **Why should people listen to you?**
    * I studied computer science and psychology at BYU, with the intent to
      create software that helps people.
    * Over the years, I've seen in my own life and in the lives of others from
      all backgrounds that self-monitoring is a critical part of personal growth.
      (**TODO** Bring in stronger reasoning and data here, perhaps including
      principles from the chapter on monitoring from _Better than Before_ by
      Gretchen Rubin)
5. **What do you believe that all your competitors disagree with?**
    * The user's data is _theirs_. They should be able to take it with them and
    should be able to trust that no-one else can read it and that it won't be
    used for training AI.
    * External accountability is not the primary mechanism by which people change.
    People are intrisically motivated to grow and improve. They just need the
    right tools to get past their cognitive limitations and biases. See _Drive_
    by Dan Pink. (**TODO** Read _Thinking Fast and Slow_ as well)
6. **What values do you believe so strongly that you're willing to lose money
   rather than violate them?**
    * Preserving and promoting user agency is more important than making money.
    See the first point under "What aren't you?" above, and the point about data
    portability above.
    * Preserving individual privacy is more important than making money
    * Business incentives should be structured to minimize perverse incentives
      and prioritize user wellbeing
